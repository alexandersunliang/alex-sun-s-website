    "text": "Hi! I am currently an undergraduate student specializing in Economics and Statistics at the University of Toronto. I have extensive experience with research and practical experiences that span across scientific studies and intellectual property.\nMy first project began at the University of British Columbia, where I led a pioneering study on the effectiveness of various control methods against Heterosigma akashiwo and Synechococcus WH7803. My approach, combining a host-specific double-stranded DNA virus with barley straw extract, marked a significant breakthrough in algacidal treatments, enhancing effectiveness by 80% over existing market solutions.\nI joined the Innovation Asset Collective as an Intellectual Property Researcher in August 2022. I composed a comprehensive bill summary of the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and Artificial Intelligence and Data Act, distributed to 287 client companies. My work extended to writing case studies for presentation at annual conferences."
